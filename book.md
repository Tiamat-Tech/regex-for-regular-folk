Regular expressions are typically formatted as `/<rules>/<flags>`. Often people will drop the slashes and the flags for brevity. We’ll get into the details of flags in a later chapter, but the one you need to now now is `g`, which stands for “global”.

Let’s start with a very basic regex: `/p/g`.

As we can see, `/p/g` matches all lowercase `p` characters. Note that regexes are case sensitive by default. If the regex has one or more matches within the input string, it is said to “match” the regex.
