## Style

### Commit messages

Please format your commit messages according to [the seven rules of commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules). You can look through the repo's commit history for examples.

You can test your commit messages with:

```sh
npx seven-rule-msg 'Add advanced examples'
```

### Code and markdown files

We use [prettier](https://prettier.io) for formatting our code and mdx files.

Check for formatting errors:

```sh
npm run lint-check
```

Fix formatting errors:

```sh
npm run lint
```

### Language guidelines

We use British English.

We use [alex](https://alexjs.com) to automatically test for inconsiderate language.

```sh
npm run alex
```

It isn't very cleverâ€”sorry if it bothers you with false-positives. Please try to use synonyms, if possible.
