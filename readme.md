# Regular Expressions for Regular Folk

![Node CI](https://github.com/shreyasminocha/regex-for-regular-folk/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)

This is an experimental ‚Äúbook‚Äù about regular expressions. It is largely _visual_ and _example-based_, as opposed to most regex resources I found while I was learning. I also attempted to choose test cases that highlight some common gotchas. I think it‚Äôll be worth your time.

This book‚Äôs intended audience is _regex beginners_. Some programming experience is assumed. It does not go into advanced regex concepts like engine backtracking and recursive regexes‚Äîat least not at the moment.

This is also an open source project, and contributions are welcome.
