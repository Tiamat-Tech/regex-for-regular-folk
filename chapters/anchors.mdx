title: Anchors
---

Anchors do not match anything by themselves. Instead, they place restrictions on where matches may appear—"anchoring" matches.

You could also think about anchors as "zero-width" characters.

### Beginning of line — `^`

Marked by a carat (`^`) at the beginning of the regex, this anchor makes it necessary for the rest of the regex to _match from the beginning of the string_.

You can think of it as matching an _invisible character_ always present at the _beginning_ of the string.

<Example regex={/^p/g}>
    <String>photoshop</String>
    <String>pineapple</String>
    <String>tap</String>
    <String>apple</String>
    <String>ppap</String>
    <String>mango</String>
</Example>

### End of line — `$`

This anchor marked by a dollar (`$`) at the end of the regex. It is analogous to the beginning of the line anchor.

You can think of it as matching an _invisible character_ always present at the _end_ of the string.

<Example regex={/p$/g}>
    <String>photoshop</String>
    <String>pineapple</String>
    <String>apple</String>
    <String>app</String>
    <String>Plum</String>
    <String>mango</String>
</Example>

---

The `^` and `$` anchors are often used in conjunction to ensure that the regex matches the entirety of the string, rather than just a part.

<Example regex={/^p$/g}>
    <String>p</String>
    <String>pi</String>
    <String>pea</String>
    <String>tarp</String>
    <String>apple</String>
</Example>

Let's revisit an example from [_Repetition_](/chapters/repetition), except we add the two anchors at the ends of the regex.

<Example regex={/^https?$/g}>
    <String>http</String>
    <String>https</String>
    <String>http/2</String>
    <String>shttp</String>
    <String>ftp</String>
</Example>

In the absence of the anchors, both `http/2` and `shttp` would match.

### Word boundary — `\b`

A word boundary is a _position_ between a [word character](/chapters/character-escapes#word-character--w) and a non-word character.

The word boundary anchor, `\b`, once again matches an imaginary invisible character that exists between consecutive word and non-word characters.

<Example regex={/\bp/g}>
    <String>peach</String>
    <String>banana, peach</String>
    <String>banana+peach</String>
    <String>banana-peach</String>
    <String>banana_peach</String>
    <String>banana%20peach</String>
    <String>grape</String>
</Example>
<Note>
    Words characters include <code>a-z</code>, <code>A-Z</code>,{" "}
    <code>0-9</code>, and <code>_</code>.
</Note>
<Example regex={/\bp\b/g}>
    <String>word p word</String>
    <String>(p)</String>
    <String>p+q+r</String>
    <String>(paren)</String>
    <String>(loop)</String>
    <String>loops</String>
</Example>

There is also a non-word-boundary anchors: `\B`.

As the name suggests, it matches everything apart from word boundaries.

<Example regex={/\Bp/g}>
    <String>ape</String>
    <String>leap</String>
    <String>(leap)</String>
    <String>a pot</String>
    <String>pea</String>
</Example>
<Example regex={/\Bp\B/g}>
    <String>ape</String>
    <String>_peel</String>
    <String>leap</String>
    <String>(leap)</String>
    <String>a pot</String>
    <String>pea</String>
</Example>
