title: Flags
---

<Note>This section is a Work In Progress.</Note>

Flags (or "modifiers") allow us to put regexes into different "modes".

Flags are the part after the final `/` in `/pattern/`.

Different engines support different flags. We'll explore some of the most common flags here.

## Global (`g`)

All examples thus far have had the global flag. When the global flag isn't enabled, the regex doesn't match anything beyond the first match.

<Example regex={/[aeiou]/g}>
    <li>corona</li>
    <li>cancel</li>
    <li>rhythm</li>
</Example>

<Example regex={/[aeiou]/}>
    <li>corona</li>
    <li>cancel</li>
    <li>rhythm</li>
</Example>

## (Case) Insensitive (`i`)

As the name suggests, enabling this flag makes the regex case-insensitive in its matching.

<Example regex={/#[0-9A-F]{6}/i}>
    <li>#AE25AE</li>
    <li>#555555</li>
    <li>Even #a2ca2c?</li>
    <li>#FFF</li>
</Example>

<Example regex={/#[0-9A-F]{6}/}>
    <li>#AE25AE</li>
    <li>#555555</li>
    <li>Even #a2ca2c?</li>
    <li>#FFF</li>
</Example>

<Example regex={/#[0-9A-Fa-f]{6}/}>
    <li>#AE25AE</li>
    <li>#555555</li>
    <li>Even #a2ca2c?</li>
    <li>#FFF</li>
</Example>

## Multiline (`m`)

<Support>
    In Ruby, the <code>m</code> flag performs{" "}
    <a href="#dot-all-s">other functions</a>.
</Support>

The multiline flag has to do with the regex's handling of anchors when dealing with "multiline" strings—strings that include newlines (`\n`). By default, the regex `/^foo$/` would match only `"foo"`.

We might want it to match `foo` when it is in a line by itself in a multiline string.

Let's take the string `"bar\nfoo\nbaz"` as an example:

```
bar
foo
baz
```

Without the multiline flag, the string above would be considered as a single line `bar\nfoo\nbaz` for matching purposes. The regex `^foo$` would thus **not match** anything.

With the multiline flag, the input would be considered as three "lines": `bar`, `foo`, and `baz`. The regex `^foo$` _would match_ the line in the middle—`foo`.

## Dot-all (`s`)

<Support>
    JavaScript, prior to ES2018, did not support this flag. Ruby does not
    support the flag, instead using <code>m</code> for the same.
</Support>

The `.` typically matches any character except newlines. With the dot-all flag, it matches newlines too.

## Unicode (`u`)

## Whitespace extended (`x`)
