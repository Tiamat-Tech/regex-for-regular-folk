title: Flags
---

Think of flags as a means of allowing us to put our regexes into different "modes". Remember how we took for granted the part after the final `/` in `/pattern/`? We'll get into the details of those now.

There are 5 kinds of flags:

-   `g` — global
-   `i` — (case) insensitive
-   `m` — multiline

## Global (`g`)

All examples thus far have had the global flag. When the global flag isn't enabled, the regex doesn't match anything beyond the first match.

<Example regex={/[aeiou]/g}>
    <String>corona</String>
    <String>cancel</String>
    <String>rhythm</String>
</Example>
<Example regex={/[aeiou]/}>
    <String>corona</String>
    <String>cancel</String>
    <String>rhythm</String>
</Example>

## (Case) Insensitive (`i`)

As the name suggests, enabling the "insensitive" flag makes the regex case insensitive about matching text.

<Example regex={/#[0-9A-F]{6}/i}>
    <String>#AE25AE</String>
    <String>#555555</String>
    <String>Even #a2ca2c?</String>
    <String>#FFF</String>
</Example>
<Example regex={/#[0-9A-F]{6}/}>
    <String>#AE25AE</String>
    <String>#555555</String>
    <String>Even #a2ca2c?</String>
    <String>#FFF</String>
</Example>
<Example regex={/#[0-9A-Fa-f]{6}/}>
    <String>#AE25AE</String>
    <String>#555555</String>
    <String>Even #a2ca2c?</String>
    <String>#FFF</String>
</Example>

## Multiline (`m`)

The multiline flag has to do with the regex's handling of anchors when dealing with "multiline" strings, that is strings that include newlines (`\n`) and thus spans over multiple lines. By default, the regex `/^foo$/` would match only `"foo"`.

We might want it to match `foo` when it is in a line by itself in a multiline string.

Let's take the string `"bar\nfoo\nbaz"` as an example:

```
bar
foo
baz
```

Without the multiline flag, the string above would be considered as a single line for matching purposes. The regex `^foo$` **would not** match since the beginning of line would be before `b` and the end of line would be after `z`.

With the multiline flag, it would be considered as three "lines": `bar`, `foo`, and `baz`. The regex `^foo$` _would match_ the "line" in the middle—`foo`.
