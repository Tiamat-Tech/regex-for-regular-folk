title: Groups

Groups, as the name suggests, are meant to be used to "group" components of regular expressions. These groups can be used to:

-   Extract subsets of matches
-   Repeat groups an arbitrary number of times
-   Backreferences
-   Enhance readability
-   Allow complex alternations

We'll see how to do a lot of this in later chapters, but learning how groups work will allow us to study some great examples in these later chapters.

## Capturing groups

Capturing groups are denoted by `(` … `)`. Here's an expository example:

<Example regex={/a(bcd)e/g}>
    <li>abcde</li>
    <li>abcdefg?</li>
    <li>abcde</li>
</Example>

This regex is functionally identical to `/abcde/g`.

Capturing groups allow _extracting_ parts of matches.

<!-- Insert example -->

Capturing groups can also be used to group regex parts for ease of [repetition](/repetition) of said group.[^1] While we will cover repetition in detail in chapters that follow, here's an example that demonstrates the utility of groups.

<Example regex={/a(bcd)+e/g}>
    <li>abcdefg</li>
    <li>abcdbcde</li>
    <li>abcdbcdbcdef</li>
    <li>ae</li>
</Example>

Other times, they are used to group logically similar parts of the regex for readability.

<Example regex={/(\d\d\d\d)-W(\d\d)/g}>
    <li>2020-W12</li>
    <li>1970-W01</li>
    <li>2050-W50-6</li>
    <li>12050-W50</li>
</Example>

### Backreferences

Backreferences allow matching previously _capture substrings_ multiple times.

The match from the first group would be `\1`, that from the second would be `\2`, and so on…

<Example regex={/([abc])×\1×\1/g}>
    <li>a×a×a</li>
    <li>ab×b×b</li>
    <li>a×b×c</li>
</Example>

Backreferences _cannot_ be used to reduce duplication in regexes. They refer to _the match_ of groups, not the pattern.

<Example regex={/[abc][abc][abc]/g}>
    <li>abc</li>
    <li>a cable</li>
    <li>aaa</li>
    <li>bbb</li>
    <li>ccc</li>
</Example>

<Example regex={/([abc])\1\1/g}>
    <li>abc</li>
    <li>a cable</li>
    <li>aaa</li>
    <li>bbb</li>
    <li>ccc</li>
</Example>

Here's an example that demonstrates a common use-case:

<Example regex={/\w+([,|])\w+\1\w+/g}>
    <li>comma,separated,values</li>
    <li>pipe|separated|values</li>
    <li>wb|mixed,delimiters</li>
    <li>wb,mixed|delimiters</li>
</Example>

This cannot be achieved with a repeated character classes.

<Example regex={/\w+[,|]\w+[,|]\w+/g}>
    <li>comma,separated,values</li>
    <li>pipe|separated|values</li>
    <li>wb|mixed,delimiters</li>
    <li>wb,mixed|delimiters</li>
</Example>

## Non-capturing groups

Non-capturing groups are very similar to capturing groups, except that they don't create "captures". They take the form `(?:` … `)`.

Non-capturing groups are usually used in conjunction with capturing groups. Perhaps you are attempting to extract some parts of the matches using capturing groups. You may wish to use a group _without messing up the order of the captures_. This is where non-capturing groups come handy.

## Examples

### Query String Parameters

<Example regex={/^\?(\w+)=(\w+)(?:&(\w+)=(\w+))*$/g}>
    <li></li>
    <li>?</li>
    <li>?a=b</li>
    <li>?a=b&foo=bar</li>
</Example>

We match the first key-value pair separately because that allows us to use `&`, the separator, as part of the repeating group.

### (Basic) HTML tags

As a rule of thumb, _do not_ use regex to match XML/HTML.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

However, it's a relevant example:

<Example regex={/<([a-z]+)+>(.*)<\/\1>/gi}>
    <li>{"<p>paragraph</p>"}</li>
    <li>{"<li>list item</li>"}</li>
    <li>{"<p><span>nesting</span></p>"}</li>
    <li>{"<p>hmm</li>"}</li>
    <li>{"<p><p>not clever</p></p></p>"}</li>
</Example>
