## Groups

Groups, as the name suggests, are meant to be used to “group” components of regular expressions. These groups can be used to:

-   Extract subsets of matches
-   Enhance readability
-   Repeat groups an arbitrary number of times
-   Make the group optional

We’ll see how to do a lot of this in later chapters, but learning how groups work will allow us to study some great examples in these later chapters.
