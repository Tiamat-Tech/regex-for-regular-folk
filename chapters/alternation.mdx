## Alternation

Alternation allows matching _one_ of several phrases. This is more powerful than character classes, which allow matching one of several characters.

Delimit the set of phrases with pipes—`|`.

<Example source="foo|bar|baz" flags="g">
    <String>foo baz</String>
    <String>Your food</String>
    <String>Behind bars</String>
</Example>

> One of `foo`, `bar`, and `baz`

If only a part of the regex is to be "alternated", wrap that part with a [group](/chapter/groups)—capturing or non-capturing.

<Example source="Try (foo|bar|baz)" flags="g">
    <String>Try foo</String>
    <String>Try bar</String>
    <String>Try baz</String>
    <String>Try food</String>
</Example>

> `Try` followed by one of `foo`, `bar`, and `baz`

---

Matching numbers between 100 and 250:

<Example source="1\d\d|2[0-4]\d|250" flags="g">
    <String>100, 157, 199</String>
    <String>139 + 140 = 279</String>
    <String>201 INR</String>
    <String>$220</String>
    <String>250</String>
    <String>1250</String>
    <String>e = 2.71828182...</String>
    <String>251</String>
    <String>729</String>
</Example>
