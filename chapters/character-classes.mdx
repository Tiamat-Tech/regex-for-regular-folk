## Character classes

It’s possible to match a character from one of several characters. Here’s an example:

<Example source="[aeiou]" flags="g">
    <String>avocado</String>
    <String>brinjal</String>
    <String>onion</String>
    <String>rhythm</String>
</Example>

Our regex `/[aeiou]/g` matches all vowels in our input strings.

Here’s another example of these in action:

<Example source="p[aeiou]t" flags="g">
    <String>pat</String>
    <String>pet</String>
    <String>pit</String>
    <String>spat</String>
    <String>spot a pet</String>
    <String>bat</String>
</Example>

We match a `p`, followed by one of the vowels, followed by a `t`.

There’s an intuitive shortcut for matching a character from within a continuous _range_.

<Example source="[a-z]" flags="g">
    <String>john_s</String>
    <String>matej29</String>
    <String>Ayesha?!</String>
    <String>4952</String>
    <String>LOUD</String>
</Example>

We can combine ranges and individual characters in our regexes.

<Example source="[A-Za-z0-9_-]" flags="g">
    <String>john_s</String>
    <String>matej29</String>
    <String>Ayesha?!</String>
    <String>4952</String>
    <String>LOUD</String>
</Example>

Our regex `/[A-Za-z0-9_-]/g` matches a single character, which must be (at least) one of the following:

- from `A-Z`
- from `a-z`
- from `0-9`
- one of `_` and `-`.

We can also “negate” these rules:

<Example source="[^aeiou]" flags="g">
    <String>Umbrella</String>
    <String>cauliflower</String>
    <String>ou</String>
</Example>

The only difference between the first regex of this chapter and `/[^aeiou]/g` is the `^` immediately after the opening bracket. Its purpose is to negate the rules defined within the brackets. We are now saying:

> “match any character that is _not_ any of _«blah»_, _«blah»_ or _«blah»_.

… instead of:

> “match any character that is at least one of _«blah»_, _«blah»_ and _«blah»_”

Here, _«blah»_ is either an individual character or a range of characters.
