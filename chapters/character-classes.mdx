It's possible to match a character from one of several characters. Here's an example:

<Example regex={/[aeiou]/g}>
    <String>avocado</String>
    <String>brinjal</String>
    <String>onion</String>
    <String>rhythm</String>
</Example>

Our regex `/[aeiou]/g` matches all vowels in our input strings.

Here's another example of these in action:

<Example regex={/p[aeiou]t/g}>
    <String>pat</String>
    <String>pet</String>
    <String>pit</String>
    <String>spat</String>
    <String>spot a pet</String>
    <String>bat</String>
</Example>

We match a `p`, followed by one of the vowels, followed by a `t`.

There's an intuitive shortcut for matching a character from within a continuous _range_.

<Example regex={/[a-z]/g}>
    <String>john_s</String>
    <String>matej29</String>
    <String>Ayesha?!</String>
    <String>4952</String>
    <String>LOUD</String>
</Example>
<Warning>
    The regex <code>/[a-z]/g</code> matches only one character. In the example
    above, the strings have{" "}
    <em>several matches each, each one character long</em>. Not one long match.
</Warning>

We can combine ranges and individual characters in our regexes.

<Example regex={/[A-Za-z0-9_-]/g}>
    <String>john_s</String>
    <String>matej29</String>
    <String>Ayesha?!</String>
    <String>4952</String>
    <String>LOUD</String>
</Example>

Our regex `/[A-Za-z0-9_-]/g` matches a single character, which must be (at least) one of the following:

-   from `A-Z`
-   from `a-z`
-   from `0-9`
-   one of `_` and `-`.

We can also "negate" these rules:

<Example regex={/[^aeiou]/g}>
    <String>Umbrella</String>
    <String>cauliflower</String>
    <String>ou</String>
</Example>

The only difference between the first regex of this chapter and `/[^aeiou]/g` is the `^` immediately after the opening bracket. Its purpose is to negate the rules defined within the brackets. We are now saying:

> "match any character that is _not_ any of _«blah»_, _«blah»_ or _«blah»_.

… instead of:

> "match any character that is at least one of _«blah»_, _«blah»_ and _«blah»_"

Here, _«blah»_ is either an individual character or a range of characters.

## Examples

### Username validation

<Example regex={/^[a-zA-Z_0-9-]+$/g}>
    <String>TheLegend27</String>
    <String>WaterGuy12</String>
    <String>Smokie_Bear</String>
    <String>Robert'); DROP TABLE Students;--</String>
</Example>

### Ambiguous characters

<Example regex={/[^A-HJ-NP-Za-kmnp-z2-9]/g}>
    <String>foo</String>
    <String>lily</String>
    <String>lI0O1</String>
    <String>unambiguity</String>
</Example>
