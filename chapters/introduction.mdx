Regular expressions ("regex") are niche tool. You wouldn't need them often, but when you do, they'll save you tons of time.

> A **regular expression** is a sequence of characters that define a _search pattern_.

Indeed, regular expressions allow defining a pattern and executing it against strings. Substrings which match the pattern are termed "matches".

Regex finds utility in:

-   input validation
-   find-replace operations
-   advanced string manipulation
-   file search or rename
-   whitelists and blacklists

Simultaneously, regular expressions are _terrible_ for other kinds of problems like:

-   parsing XML or HTML
-   exactly matching dates

There are several regex implementations—regex engines—each with its own quirks and features. This book will avoid going into the fine differences between these, instead sticking to features that are, for the most part, common across engines.

The example blocks that feature throughout the book are rendered using javascript.
